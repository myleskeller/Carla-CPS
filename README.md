# Carla-CPS

This is a client-side python file that interacts with the PythonAPI component of carla. 

It attempts to simulate data propagation across actors within a map in the form of vehicles, walkers, and specific semantic nodes.

To run it:
 - start your carla server instance (you can download precompiled binaries off of their official github)
 - open a command prompt
 - enter `python manual_control_AObstacleDetectionSensor.py --sync`
